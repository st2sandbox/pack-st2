# Community Sandbox for StackStorm-Exchange/stackstorm-st2

Let's speed up the pace of StackStorm development together, in the st2sandbox!

_This repository contains experimental major changes for StackStorm's st2 pack.
The st2sandbox organization is NOT an official StackStorm project and is not affiliated with the Linux Foundation._


## Collaborators welcome!

**Anyone can create a team and build an experiment for StackStorm st2 pack.**

Commit rights are offered very liberally with these two rules:

1. Don't be an idiot.
2. Don't annoy upstream with issues from this repo.

Once an experiment proves its worth, we can create a collective PR against the upstream repo.
However, be forewarned: All contributors to an experiment will have to sign StackStorm's CLA
before the contribution can be accepted by the upstream maintainers.

If you want to create a new experiment + team:
File a request here: https://github.com/st2sandbox/pack-st2/discussions/categories/commit-access

Someone will give you access ASAP. Remember we're all volunteers here--so no guarantees--but
the goal is to speed up StackStorm development by giving more people shared commit rights.
